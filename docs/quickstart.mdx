## 1. Create a Permit account

The first step is creating an account. This account will be used to configure and manage the authorization layer of your application.

:::note Social Logins and SSO
You can log into Permit with your Google / GitHub account.
Permit also offers Single Sign-On (SSO) login functionality, allowing users to access their accounts using enterprise credentials.
SSO is provided as the default option in [Permitâ€™s Enterprise Tier](http://permit.io/pricing), or as a standalone option at a yearly
defined rate.

To get a custom quote on SSO, reach out to us via our **[Slack Community](https://io.permit.io/docs-to-slack)**.

## 2. Creating a workspace & naming your organization

First, you will need to create your workspace (Or, organizational account), under which all of your configurations,
projects, and environments reside. This will often correspond with your companyâ€™s name.

:::tip Example:
We have a company called "Company A" - this is our business, so that's what we will call our organization

:::note
You can have multiple workspaces and switch between them - although usually, you'd only need one. Workspaces are completely
siloed from one another.

Thatâ€™s it! You can now launch your account! ðŸ¥³ Now that you have all the basics set up, you can connect Permit to a demo application and see your
defined policy come to life.
