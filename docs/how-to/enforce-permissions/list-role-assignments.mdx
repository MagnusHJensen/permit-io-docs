Beside of the classic `check` and data filtering functions, applications might need access to some additional information such as the list of role assignments, list of roles, list of tenants, etc.

To help your application perform such operations efficiently, Permit provides some of these APIs as part of the local [PDP container](/how-to/deploy/deploy-to-production). Using these APIs in the local PDP avoids the latency in the network and provides faster responses.


:::note APIs Availability

Permit is rolling out such APIs gradually, and these pages list the available APIs as of now. If you want any other function to be exposed from the PDP, please reach out to us in [our Slack environment](https://io.permit.io/slack).

## List Role Assignments

> This function is available from version `permitio/pdp-v2:0.3.0` and above of the PDP container.


The `permit.pdp_api.role_assignments.list` function (or `/local/role_assignments` via the REST API) returns the list of role assignments from the local PDP.
You can also use the advanced filters to return role assignments based on the user, tenant, resource, role, and resource instance.

The function accepts optional `user_key`, `tenant_key`, `resource_key`, `role_key`, `resource_instance_key` filters,
and returns a list of role assignments that match the filters. 

The response contains list of objects with the following fields:
- `user_key` - The user to whom the role is assigned.
- `tenant_key` - The tenant to which the role is assigned,
    in case of resource role, this represents the tenant that the resource instance is associated with.
- `role_key` - The role assigned to the user.
- `resource_instance_key` ( optional ) - The resource instance to which the role is assigned.

The schema of the response is as follows:
```json
[
    {
        "user": "jane@coolcompany.com",
        "role": "admin",
        "tenant": "stripe-inc"
    },
    {
        "user": "jane@coolcompany.com",
        "role": "admin",
        "tenant": "stripe-inc",
        "resource_instance": "document:doc-1234"
    }
]
```

:::note Pagination

This function is paginated and returns a maximum of 100 role assignments per page. <br />
You can use the `page` and `per_page` parameters to navigate through the pages.

## Usage Examples
### Usage
You can use the function directly to list all the assignments or use one or more of the filters based on the `user`, `tenant`, `resource`, `role`, `resource_instance` to filter the results.
It is also possible to mix any of the filters without any restrictions.


### List all role assignments

This function call will return all the role assignments from the local PDP.

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python
from permit.models.pdp import RoleAssignmentRead

permissions: RoleAssignmentRead = permit.pdp_api.role_assignments.list();

```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Filter by user

Another useful example is a call that filters the role assignments based on the user, this way you can get all the roles assigned to a specific user and enforce the permissions based on it.

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python
from permit.models.pdp import RoleAssignmentRead

permissions: RoleAssignmentRead = permit.pdp_api.role_assignments.list(
    user="John",
)

```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


### Filter by Resource Instance

On the "opposite" way of the previous example, you can filter the role assignments based on the resource instance, this way you can get all the roles assigned to a specific resource instance and enforce the permissions based on it.

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python
from permit.models.pdp import RoleAssignmentRead

permissions: RoleAssignmentRead = permit.pdp_api.role_assignments.list(
    resource_instance_key="document:onboarding-doc",
)

```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

import { some } from "lodash";
