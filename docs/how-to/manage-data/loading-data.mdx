import addingAttributes from "/static/ui-videos/how-to/loading-data/attributes-to-user.mp4";

There are multiple ways you can load data into Permit, and we will cover all of them below.

## Via a user in the UI

When navigating to the user interface, you have the option to edit the user attributes for each unique user. These attributes
are then sent to the Permit backend and stored by with the user record in our database.

As you perform a `permit.check()` for any individual user to check his access, these attributes are dynamically loaded into the
function and the enforcement is evaluated based on the policy and the user attributes.

## Via the `permit.check()` function

As a `permit.check()` is called, it checks and verifies the actions a user might have on a particular resource. The three parameters
you need to pass into the function are the `unique user id`, `action` and `resource`. As part of the function, rather than passing
in the `user id` and `resource`, you can pass in a whole object that will contain the user or resource attributes.

These attributes are evaluated on each enforcement check. This also gives you the flexibility to pass in **dynamic**
/ **just-in-time** attributes and evaluate these against the policies.

Here is an example of the code:

```javascript
const permitted = await permit.check(
	{
		key: "john@smith.com",
		attributes: {
			location: "England",
			department: "Engineering",
		},
	},
	"read",
	{
		type: "file",
		attributes: {
			isPaying: "true",
		},
	}
);
```

## Via the API

Permit provides an elegantly crafted API editor designed to streamline the structuring of your policies, facilitate seamless
audits, and effectively manage team members, among other functions. Notably, the entire no-code user interface operates on a
fully API-driven backbone, allowing for the seamless automation of any action within the system.

:::note
You can find the whole redoc referencing all the API functionality [here](https://api.permit.io/v2/redoc).
:::

In general, you can define attributes for individual users, or individual resources. You can follow the API call to define
**[user attributes](https://api.permit.io/v2/redoc#tag/User-Attributes)** and
**[resource attributes](https://api.permit.io/v2/redoc#tag/Resource-Attributes)**.

## Via OPAL

With the new Scope Config API, you can set your own data sources when setting up your GitOps policy. This means you can easily
mix the simplicity of Permit.io with OPAL's ability to be tailored to your needs.

To make changes to the OPAL Scope, use the
[OPAL Scope API](https://api.permit.io/v2/redoc#tag/Scope-Configurations). You'll just need to include the
project and environment IDs in the API endpoint URL - don't worry, our guide can show you where to find them.

Out of the box, Permit automatically pulls in details about users, roles, and more from its cloud database to OPA,
setting a solid foundation for your policy.<br />
With this API, you can add even more data sources to build a policy
that's just right for you. <br />
You can see the data structure we currently use by checking it the OpenAPI and the example [here](https://api.permit.io/v2/redoc#tag/OPAL-Data-(-EAP-)).
Notice that this API is in EAP stage might be subject to changes !

To manage attributes from external datasource and use them in Permit's Auto-Generated Rego Policies, you will need
to set up small bindings beside the Scope configuration, this guide will also show you how to do that.<br/>
*Any attributes in following rules will be merged with the attributes you store in Permit & the attributes you provide in the input.*
*The merge is done with the following rules input > custom > stored.*<br/>
The currently supported external attributes are:<br/>
1. `custom_user_attributes` - User attributes to be merged with the stored & input attributes.
2. `custom_tenant_attributes` - Tenant attributes to be merged with the stored & input attributes.
3. `custom_resource_attributes` - Resource attributes to be merged with the stored & input attributes.
4. `custom_context_attributes` - Context attributes to be merged with the input attributes.

For instance, in this guide, we'll show you how to add information from around the world using data
from [https://restcountries.com](https://restcountries.com).

We will get the data from the [Rest Countries API](https://restcountries.com) and set it as a
under `countries` key in the data object using custom data source in the OPAL Scope.
This will allow us to use the data in our Rego policies.

1. Configure custom data sources using Permit API

    ```
    curl --location --request PUT 'https://api.permit.io/v2/projects/{project_id}/{env_id}/opal_scope' \

    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \

    --header 'Accept: application/json' \

    --header 'Authorization: Bearer permit_key_***' \

    --data '{

         "data": {

              "entries": [

                   {

                        "url": "https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all",

                        "dst_path": "/countries",

                        "config": {

                             "headers": {

                                  "Accept": "application/json"

                             }

                        }

                   }

              ]

         }

    }'
    ```

    :::note
    You can see the data stored inside OPA by running the following command:
    ```bash
    curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:8181/v1/data' \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer permit*key* {{secret}}'
    ```
    :::
2. You can define custom attributes in your rego policies,
    to do so we need to add something similar to the following code in the `custom` directory in your [gitops](/integrations/gitops/overview) repo:

    ```rego
    package permit.custom
    import future.keywords.in

    region_by_common_name[name] := region {
        some _,country in data.countries
        name := country.name.common
        region := country.region
    }

    custom_user_attributes["region"] := region_by_common_name[data.users[input.user.key].attributes.country]
    ```

    By adding this we can now know the region of the user based on the country they are in using the attributes we've loaded
    from the external data source.
    Similar to this you can add any custom attributes you want to use in your policies from any external data source.
    For example, you can load data from stripe and add billing attributes for your users to use in your policies.
3. Define ABAC conditions using by following this [guide](/how-to/build-policies/abac/building-abac-policy#define-a-user-set).
4. That's it! The custom attributes are now used in your policies.


[API Docs](https://api.permit.io/v2/redoc#tag/Scope-Configurations) for Scope Request (API still in beta):

![](/img/features/projects-and-env/scope-api.png)

You can view the full OPAL Scope documentation **[here](https://docs.opal.ac/getting-started/running-opal/run-opal-server/data-sources)**.

:::info
**Custom scopes are supported from PDP v0.2.15**
:::

Make sure you have pulled the latest PDP container.

```bash
docker pull permitio/pdp-v2:latest
```

Make sure you have enabled the _`OPAL_SPLIT_ROOT_DATA`_ flag when running the container.

```bash
OPAL_SPLIT_ROOT_DATA=1
```

For example, if you are running it with docker, it will look like the example below:

```bash
docker run -e PDP_API_KEY=<YOUR-PERMIT-API-KEY> -e OPAL_SPLIT_ROOT_DATA=1 permitio/pdp-v2:latest
```

If the GitOps feature is activated in your account, you can enhance your Rego policies by integrating data from the custom
data source as illustrated below:

```json
data.countries[0].capital == "Bridgetown"
```
