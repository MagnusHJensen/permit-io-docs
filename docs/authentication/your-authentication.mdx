## Integrate Permit with any Authentication Provider

As part of the whole IAM flow, as well as Authorization, Authentication too plays an important role in the process.

:::info
**Permit integrates flawlessly into ANY Authentication provider on the market** as long as they can issue a **JWT (JSON Web Token)**.
Most providers make use of this standard for **encrypting user information**.
:::

While using any Authentication provider and the JWT they provide, you are able to **extract the unique ID of the current user**, along
with other information like their email and name - and **easily sync that information into Permit**, or **check agains the unique ID**.

:::tip
We provide the **SyncUser function** for all our **SDK's**.
:::

All of this process usually happends at the **handoff point**; or in other words a middleware function - making sure that both the AuthN and AuthZ
solutions are aware of the same user.

Please feel free to explore the following available examples of Authentication solutions working with Permit. **We will be adding more
example integrations as time goes by**.
